#BABLESH KHALIFA ROCKS

Let's start with the platform.  

Why should this thing exist in the first place in a world where you have various chatting platforms like WhatsApp, Discord, or Telegram?  

## The answer starts with the basic definition of a social media platform, which is:  
> A social media platform (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) is nothing but a representation of human interaction in the real world, or you could say an attempt to reproduce real-world interaction digitally with all its leverage.  

But we're here to talk about a niche, which includes platforms like Discord, WhatsApp, etc.  
The plan is to create a platform that is capable of most things that Discord, WhatsApp, and Telegram do—only better. Discord is a great platform in terms of features, but when viewed from a normal user's perspective, it feels like an airplane cockpit—so many tabs go unused, even on servers that have existed for years.  

# Initial Idea  
We're trying to make the UI more like WhatsApp but with features like Discord. The goal is to make it as minimal as WhatsApp and as feature-rich as Discord.  

Apart from all this, I have a very personal take:  
Discord has all the capabilities to replace WhatsApp and Telegram without compromising its existing user base, but they've made it more like a plane cockpit.  

> The above-written points are the only things we're sure about because human interaction is a much more sophisticated act than it seems—many trials and errors down the line, along with the same amount of discoveries as well.
